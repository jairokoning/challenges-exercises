## üöÄ Challenge
- **Exercise 1: Simple Calculator**
Create a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and returns the result of the operation.
- **Exercise 2: Prime Numbers**
Write a function that checks whether a number is prime or not. Then create a program that prints the first 10 prime numbers.
- **Exercise 3: Factorial**
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. Next, create a program that allows the user to enter a number and displays the corresponding factorial.
- **Exercise 4: Palindrome**
Create a function that checks whether a word is a palindrome (that is, whether it reads the same backwards and forwards). The program must ask the user for a word and inform whether or not it is a palindrome.
- **Exercise 5: Table**
Create a program that receives a number from the user and displays the table of that number, from 1 to 10.
